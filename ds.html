        <h2>1.DBMS</h2>
        <p>Database Management System (DBMS) is a software system that allows users to define, create, maintain, and control access to databases. It serves as an interface between the database and the users or application programs, ensuring that data is organized efficiently, and users can interact with it easily and securely. </p>
    </section>

        <h2>2. SQL</h2>
        <p>SQL, which stands for Structured Query Language, is a domain-specific programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It provides a standardized way to interact with databases, enabling users to perform various operations such as querying, updating, inserting, and deleting data.<br>

            Here are some key points about SQL:<br>
            
            1.<b>Data Querying:</b> SQL allows users to retrieve data from databases using queries. Queries can filter, sort, and aggregate data to extract specific information based on certain criteria.<br>
            
            2.<b>Data Manipulation:</b> SQL provides commands for inserting, updating, and deleting data in databases. Users can modify existing data or add new data using SQL statements.<br>
            
            3.<b>Data Definition:</b> SQL enables users to define the structure of databases, including tables, columns, constraints, indexes, and relationships between tables. This is done using Data Definition Language (DDL) statements like CREATE, ALTER, and DROP.<br>
            
            4.<b>Data Control:</b> SQL includes commands for controlling access to databases and managing user permissions. Users can grant or revoke privileges to specific database objects, such as tables or views, using Data Control Language (DCL) statements like GRANT and REVOKE.<br>
            
            5.<b>Data Integrity:</b> SQL allows users to enforce data integrity rules to maintain the accuracy and consistency of data. This includes defining primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and check constraints to prevent invalid or inconsistent data from being stored in the database.<br>
            
            6.<b>Transaction Control:</b> SQL provides commands for managing transactions, which are sequences of database operations that are treated as a single unit of work. Users can commit or rollback transactions to ensure data consistency and reliability.<br>
            
            SQL is a standardized language that is supported by most relational database management systems (RDBMS), including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, SQL Server, and SQLite. While there are slight variations in syntax and features between different database systems, the core principles of SQL remain consistent across platforms, making it a widely used and versatile language for database management.<br></p>

        <h2>3. PL/SQL</h2>
        <p>PL/SQL stands for Procedural Language/Structured Query Language. It is an extension of SQL (Structured Query Language) that adds procedural programming capabilities to SQL. PL/SQL allows users to write procedural code directly in the database, making it possible to perform complex data processing tasks and implement business logic within the database itself.<br>

            Here are some key features of PL/SQL:<br>
            
            1.<b>Procedural Constructs:</b> PL/SQL supports procedural constructs such as loops, conditional statements (IF-THEN-ELSE), and exception handling (TRY-CATCH). This allows developers to write code that performs iterative processing, makes decisions based on conditions, and handles errors gracefully.<br>
            
            2.<b>Variables and Data Types:</b> PL/SQL allows users to declare variables and constants, assign values to them, and manipulate them using built-in functions and operators. It supports various data types such as integers, strings, dates, and records.<br>
            
            3.<b>Stored Procedures and Functions:</b> PL/SQL allows users to define stored procedures and functions, which are named blocks of code that can be called from SQL statements or other PL/SQL blocks. Stored procedures can accept input parameters and return output values, while functions return a single value.<br>
            
            4.<b>Triggers:</b> PL/SQL supports triggers, which are special types of stored procedures that are automatically executed in response to certain database events, such as insert, update, or delete operations on tables. Triggers can be used to enforce data integrity rules, audit changes, or perform other actions based on specific events.<br>
            
            5.<b>Packages:</b> PL/SQL allows users to organize related procedures, functions, and variables into packages. Packages provide a way to encapsulate and modularize code, making it easier to manage and maintain large PL/SQL programs.<br>
            
            6.<b>Cursor Variables:</b> PL/SQL supports cursor variables, also known as REF CURSORs, which allow users to pass result sets between stored procedures and functions. Cursor variables provide a flexible way to work with dynamic SQL queries and query results.<br>
            
            7.<b>Exception Handling:</b> PL/SQL provides robust exception handling mechanisms for handling errors and exceptions that may occur during program execution. Users can define exception handlers to catch and handle specific types of errors, ensuring that programs continue to run smoothly even in the presence of unexpected errors.<br>
            
            PL/SQL is primarily used in Oracle Database, where it is tightly integrated with the database engine. It allows developers to write efficient, scalable, and maintainable code directly within the database, leveraging the power of SQL for data manipulation and the flexibility of procedural programming for implementing business logic.</p>
